# Database Quiz Report - Group Work

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a student enrollment system database with proper table design, joins, indexing, and views. The solution covers all required aspects of the class quiz assignment.

## 🗄️ Database Schema Design

### Tables Created

#### 1. `students` Table

- **Primary Key:** `student_id`
- **Constraints:**
  - Unique email addresses
  - GPA validation (0.0-4.0 range)
  - NOT NULL on essential fields
- **Purpose:** Stores comprehensive student information

#### 2. `courses` Table

- **Primary Key:** `course_id`
- **Constraints:**
  - Unique course codes
  - Positive credit values
  - NOT NULL on required fields
- **Purpose:** Manages course catalog information

#### 3. `enrollments` Table (Junction Table)

- **Primary Key:** `enrollment_id`
- **Foreign Keys:**
  - `student_id` → `students.student_id`
  - `course_id` → `courses.course_id`
- **Constraints:**
  - Unique combination of student, course, semester, and year
  - Grade validation using CHECK constraint
- **Purpose:** Handles many-to-many relationship between students and courses

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Table Creation with Constraints

| Constraint Type | Implementation | Purpose |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Primary Keys** | Applied to all tables | Unique identification |
| **Foreign Keys** | Referential integrity | Maintain data relationships |
| **Unique Constraints** | Email, course codes | Prevent duplicates |
| **Check Constraints** | GPA range, grades | Data validation |
| **NOT NULL** | Essential fields | Ensure required data |

### 2. Join Operations Performed

#### 🔗 INNER JOIN

- **Purpose:** Retrieve students with their enrolled courses
- **Result:** Only students enrolled in at least one course
- **Use Case:** Active enrollment reports
- **Query Pattern:**

```sql
SELECT s.*, c.*, e.grade
FROM students s
INNER JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
INNER JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
```

#### ⬅️ LEFT JOIN

- **Purpose:** Get all students, including those not enrolled
- **Result:** Complete student list with enrollment counts
- **Use Case:** Student retention analysis
- **Benefit:** Identifies students who may need academic advising

#### ➡️ RIGHT JOIN

- **Purpose:** Get all courses, including those with no enrollments
- **Result:** Complete course list with enrollment statistics
- **Use Case:** Course popularity analysis
- **Benefit:** Helps identify underutilized courses

#### 🔄 FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated)

- **Purpose:** Complete view of all students and courses
- **Implementation:** UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins
- **Use Case:** Comprehensive system overview

### 3. Index Creation for Performance

#### Single Column Indexes

| Index Name | Column | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `idx_student_email` | `students.email` | Authentication lookups |
| `idx_student_major` | `students.major` | Major-based filtering |
| `idx_course_code` | `courses.course_code` | Course searches |
| `idx_course_department` | `courses.department` | Department queries |

#### Composite Indexes

| Index Name | Columns | Optimization Target |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| `idx_enrollment_student_course` | `student_id, course_id` | Relationship queries |
| `idx_enrollment_semester_year` | `semester, year` | Temporal queries |
| `idx_enrollment_grade` | `grade` | Grade-based filtering |

### 4. Views for Simplified Data Access

#### 👥 `student_course_summary` View

- **Purpose:** Comprehensive student overview with calculated GPA
- **Features:**
  - Full name concatenation
  - Course enrollment count
  - Real-time GPA calculation from grades
- **Benefits:** Simplifies complex student reporting queries

#### 📚 `course_enrollment_stats` View

- **Purpose:** Course performance and enrollment metrics
- **Features:**
  - Total enrollment counts per course
  - Average grade point calculations
  - Department-wise course statistics
- **Benefits:** Enables quick course analysis for administrators

#### 🏢 `department_overview` View

- **Purpose:** High-level department performance metrics
- **Features:**
  - Course counts by department
  - Total enrollment statistics
  - Department-wide GPA calculations
- **Benefits:** Supports strategic academic planning

## 💡 Sample Use Cases

### Administrative Queries

```sql
-- Identify students needing academic support
SELECT * FROM student_course_summary 
WHERE calculated_gpa < 2.5 AND total_courses > 0;

-- Find courses with low enrollment
SELECT * FROM course_enrollment_stats 
WHERE total_enrollments < 3
ORDER BY total_enrollments ASC;
```

### Academic Analytics

```sql
-- Compare department performance
SELECT 
    department,
    total_courses,
    total_enrollments,
    ROUND(department_avg_gpa, 2) as avg_gpa
FROM department_overview 
ORDER BY department_avg_gpa DESC;

-- Track semester trends
SELECT 
    semester,
    year,
    COUNT(*) as total_enrollments,
    AVG(CASE grade
        WHEN 'A+' THEN 4.0 WHEN 'A' THEN 4.0 WHEN 'A-' THEN 3.7
        WHEN 'B+' THEN 3.3 WHEN 'B' THEN 3.0 WHEN 'B-' THEN 2.7
        WHEN 'C+' THEN 2.3 WHEN 'C' THEN 2.0 WHEN 'C-' THEN 1.7
        WHEN 'D+' THEN 1.3 WHEN 'D' THEN 1.0 WHEN 'F' THEN 0.0
    END) as semester_gpa
FROM enrollments
GROUP BY semester, year
ORDER BY year DESC, semester;
```
